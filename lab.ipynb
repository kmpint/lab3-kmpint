    "Your supervisor at Amtrak has handed over more \"information\". This time, it's a few poorly formatted tables stored as *.txt*: the most standard of file formats. They want a basic map, and since Amtrak is *finally* trying to enter the digital age with all this new federal funding, they want this map to create itself with the click of a button (in this case, by running all code cells in this notebook). Like last week, you assume there will be more data coming your way in this format, so you will need to come up with an automated process that imports it, parses it, and does any subesquent operations that are necessary in order to finally prep it for the mapping intern. In other words, you need to write a program that takes data of a certain format as input, and generates clean data as an output."

    "## Importing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of any Python script (or Jupyter notebook running Python) you will usually want to import packages so that their functionality is available to the rest of your code. One of Python's great strengths is the quality of its 3rd party packages, which can provide functionality for doing anything from video editing to running a web server to... managing data! In this session, we would like to import the pandas package. Pandas allows us to manipulate data stored in pandas dataframes, and forms the bedrock of most standard data analysis done with Python today. Familiarity with other basic data management software (e.g. Excel) will serve you well here."

    "### Using a custom function to check for duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "[Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) are a great way to organize your code. Basically, you can wrap any code inside a function, which allows you to call that code from anywhere else in your code without having to rewrite the code all over again! Think of it as a more elaborate variable, but a variable that *does* stuff, instead of just holding static information. Like variables, you need to declare a function first before using it. After that, you can refer to it anywhere, as long as you pass it the right arguments!\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are declared using the 'def' keyword. Immediately following the name of the function - which is up to you to choose, much like any variable name - you need to add parentheses (()). Inside these parentheses is where you can pass arguments to the function (i.e. input data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like conditional statements or loops, function declarations are immediately followed by a colon (:), and any code nested inside a function is indented. The 'return' statement at the end of a function signals what it will output. Think of the () of the function as the point of entry, and the 'return' statement as the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. üìù You would like to write a custom function to check for duplicates so that you can freely call it from anywhere in your code. Your function should require a **list of booleans as input**, and **return a number indicating the number of duplicates** (i.e. True values) in the list that was passed to it. Use the documentation provided above to familiarize yourself with functions. As always, you can Google for further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: len() will provide the length of a list (and therefore a number). .append() can be used for appending True values to a list, which you can then use len() on as your return value."
